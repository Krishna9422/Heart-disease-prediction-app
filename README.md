# Heart-disease-prediction-app
A machine learning-powered web application for predicting heart disease risk based on patient data using a responsive Flask-based interface.
# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a web application that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical factors. The application takes user input regarding medical data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key factors to predict whether the individual is at risk of heart disease.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: The application collects various health-related data from the user including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and others.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Based on the inputs provided, the model predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Interactive Interface**: An easy-to-use form with real-time feedback and styled components for a better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS (with a responsive layout and interactive color changes)
  - JavaScript (if needed for additional frontend logic)
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or another suitable library for prediction)
  - Python for server-side logic
- **Styling**:
  - Google Fonts (Pacifico, Arimo, Hind, Open Sans Condensed)
  - Custom CSS for layout and design
